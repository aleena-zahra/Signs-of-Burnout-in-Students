## Student Burnout Detection using MBI-SS

This project explores student burnout using responses from the **Maslach Burnout Inventory - Student Survey (MBI-SS)**. We perform exploratory data analysis to visualize and understand patterns in student burnout levels, including gender-based differences and correlations among burnout symptoms.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

**Burnout in students** includes:
- Emotional exhaustion (EE)
- Cynicism toward studies (CY)
- Reduced sense of academic efficacy (AE)

The **MBI** is a reliable psychological instrument for quantifying these symptoms. Scores are aggregated to compute a **Total Burnout Score**.

## 📊 Analysis
- Load and visualize collected data
- Analyze distributions of burnout scores
- Compare burnout symptoms across genders
- Correlate individual components of burnout
- Discuss implications and next steps

## 📁 Files
- `psyproject.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook
- `Burnout Assessment Questionnaire for Univeristy Students(Responses) - Form.csv`: Input data file 

## 📈 Future Extensions
We hope to extend our project to include:
- Predict burnout using machine learning
- Clustering for risk profiling
- Longitudinal burnout tracking (if data available)

## 🤝 Contributors
- @aleena-zahra and @muaz-abdullahh we did this project as a initiative for our psychology class. The data was gotten from FAST isb students who consented to partake in the study
