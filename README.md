This project explores student burnout using responses from the Maslach Burnout Inventory Student Survey (MBI-SS). We perform exploratory data analysis to visualize and understand patterns in student burnout levels, including gender-based differences and correlations among burnout symptoms.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

**Burnout in students** includes:
- Emotional exhaustion (EE)
- Cynicism toward studies (CY)
- Reduced sense of academic efficacy (AE)

The **MBI** is a reliable psychological instrument for quantifying these symptoms. Scores are aggregated to compute a **Total Burnout Score**.
